# TicTacToe Console Application

Welcome to **TicTacToe**, the world's most exciting game (well, at least when you're bored in class). This is a simple CLI-based version of the classic game **TicTacToe**, developed in C#. 

# Video Demo
Here’s a link to a very professional video demonstration of how the game works. You know, to show the world that you’re a serious developer:
(add link)


Perfect for when you have 5 minutes to kill, and you want to pretend you're being productive by solving this timeless puzzle, while also secretly avoiding work.

## Features

- **CLI Interaction**: No fancy UIs, just pure console magic. Get your hands dirty with text-based inputs and outputs!
- **Game Logic**: The game checks for winners, ties, and everything else that makes this game so frustratingly fun.
- **File Handling**: You can save your board, load your board, and pretend like you're saving the world while you're at it.
- **Testing**: We use NUnit for unit testing because, let’s face it, who doesn’t love a good test (or hate them, but we still need them, sorry)?

3. Build the project. Don't worry, it won’t blow up your computer (we hope):

## What You Need
- ** .NET 9.0 (if you don’t have it, we have some bad news for you. You’ll need to install it first.)
- ** Basic knowledge of how to run a command in the terminal. We believe in you. You can do it.
- ** How to Test (or Pretend to Be Fancy)
- ** You might not have noticed, but there are unit tests in this project because we believe in writing tests (and also because our professor said we had to). To run them:

## Run the tests and get that sweet, sweet "all tests passed" feeling:
```bash
dotnet test
